            <h2>Swim Penguin Privacy Policy</h2>

            <p>
                Like millions of other website owners out there, we use Google Mobile Ads in Swim Penguin

                We use Google Mobile Ads to serve ads to our users.
                
                <h3>Information We May Collect From You</h3>
                We may deploy AdMob advertising in some / all of our Software where it may use an anonymous identifier, 
                which is a random string of characters that is used for the same purpose as a cookie on some mobile devices, where 
                cookie technology is not available.  AdMob is an advertising service provided by Google Inc through which third parties 
                may be using web beacons, cookies, and other technologies to collect information and usage data as a result of 
                serving ads.  We do not use AdMob's optional GPS/location-based ad targeting.
                
                <h3>Uses of the Information</h3>
                <p>
                  We may use the following ad services to help monitize the software:

                    <li>AdMob</li>
                    <li>AdSense</li>
                  </ul>

                  <br />

                  Google may use information it obtains via the third party cookies, web beacons, and other technologies used in connection with AdMob and AdSense in
