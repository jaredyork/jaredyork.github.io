                    Starting December 2015, I began working on a site for Brad Nederveld of Georgetown Driving School.  He wanted a straight-forward, multi-page site to display information relating to his driving school.
                    I laid out a solution and began meeting with him on specific goals for his site.  Every few days after the initial meeting, I sat down with him and tweaked the design down to every pixel, fine tuning the looks to his standards.
                    The website was launched January first right on target.  He was very pleased with the end result, here is a testimonial from him:
                    <blockquote class="quoted-text">
                      <p>
                        <i>
                          <span class="quote-mark">&quot;</span>If you are looking to create a website for your business or personal use, then you have come to the right place.  The first thing that attracted me to York Web Design was the price.  You can't beat the quality for the price!  Jared not only had many great ideas for developing my website, but he also was able to add everything that I wanted right down to the last detail.  Jared is such a kind and patient young man with the knack for 'anything technology.'  I highly recommend York Web Design...you won't be disappointed!<span class="quote-mark">&quot;</span>
