                    Starting December 2015, I began working on a site for Brad Nederveld of Georgetown Driving School.  He wanted a straight-forward, multi-page site to display information relating to his driving school.
                    I laid out a solution and began meeting with him on specific goals for his site.  Every few days after the initial meeting, I sat down with him and tweaked the design down to every pixel, fine tuning the looks to his standards.
                    The website was launched January first right on target.  He was very pleased with the end result, here is the testimonial from him:
                    <blockquote class="quoted-text">
                      <p>
                        <q>
                          If you are looking to create a website for your business or personal use, then you have come to the right place.  The first thing that attracted me to York Web Design was the price.  You can't beat the quality for the price!  Jared not only had many great ideas for developing my website, but he also was able to add everything that I wanted right down to the last detail.  Jared is such a kind and patient young man with the knack for 'anything technology.'  I highly recommend York Web Design...you won't be disappointed!

                    Beginning in June 2016, I have worked on developing a website for Jenison Animal Hospital, P.C.  During this project, I did not have a large role in the design process, but had more emphasis on bringing their design to life.
                    On June 30, the website launched and is fully operational.  Behind the scenes, I also added a custom editor into the site to change the content in a promotional box in the footer.  Overall, both the client and myself were quite happy with the results.
