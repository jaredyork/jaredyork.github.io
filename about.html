          <h2>My Faith</h2>
          <p>
            The time came where I made the decision to make a commitment to follow Jesus.  On June 12th, 2016, I gave my profession of faith and have since strived to follow Christ on a daily basis.
            I want to follow God's plan for my life and not lean on my own understanding, for I know He knows best.
          </p>

          <h3>What does Christ mean to me?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I believe that God has given me a path to follow for my life.  I believe that He is the light who guides me through my struggles and challenges every day.</li>
            <li>I believe that the Word of God is the truth and the light for my life, and it's that truth I'm committed to following every day.</li>
            <li>I understand God's love and grace.  I know that I sin and make mistakes every day, but I know by the power of His grace, He has delivered me from that sin.  I believe when His blood ran red, my sins were washed as white as snow.</li>
            <li>I believe that God has given me certain gifts and abilities, and I believe that He is using my life like a blueprint to build His Kingdom, one brick at a time.</li>
          </ul>

          <br />

            How I Started In Computers
            Six-years-old... that's when I started painting -- on an old Dell boat anchor and a two-times deeper than length of screen CRT monitor with Microsoft Paint on Windows XP. When I was nine-years-old, I began experimenting with a program called GameMaker 7 which is the spark that started the fire. Back then, I thought that creating and developing games was too difficult, but I persevered and by the time I was twelve I dove head-first into GameMaker 8 and created many test concepts. From GameMaker, I moved on to C# (pronounced "C-Sharp") and the XNA Game Studio framework. XNA allowed me to really get my hands dirty in what I thought of as "real programming". A few more test projects later and I began working on a game called Steer Clear, built with the XNA framework. After working on several revisions of Steer Clear, I began teaching myself JavaScript by writing a HTML5 Canvas API based version of Steer Clear.

            December of 2014, I built my first computer running Windows 8 and started learning more about the inner workings of desktop and laptop computers. This event was the diving board which propelled me into building computers for other clients.

            Using my skills harnessed from the Steer Clear project (which will be released in 2018, by the way), I launched the first website I built for a client January of 2016. Since then I've been discovering the newest in web specifications and harnessing my skills to build a second website August of 2016 for a veterinary practice. Late August of 2016 I broke ground on working on veterinary management software for that veterinary practice, which I am finishing up and rolling out as of August 2017.

            July 6 2017, I founded my own computer business, York Computer Solutions LLC specializing in custom web design services and computer builds.

          <h2>Art</h2>
          <p>
            When I was around seven and eight I really got hooked on drawing and sketching. This is when I realised the potential in my artistic abilities. For several years I've never thought of picking drawing back up, but in 2017, I decided to start drawing seriously again. You can view my art <a href="art.html">here</a> to see what I've created.
