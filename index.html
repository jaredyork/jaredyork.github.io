        <h3>How I Started In Computers</h3>
        <p>
          Six-years-old... that's when I started painting -- on an old Dell boat anchor and a two-times deeper than length of screen CRT monitor with Microsoft Paint on Windows XP.
          When I was nine-years-old, I began experimenting with a program called GameMaker 7 which is the spark that started the fire.  Back then, I thought that creating and developing games was too difficult,
          but I persevered and by the time I was twelve I dove head-first into GameMaker 8 and created many test concepts.  From GameMaker, I moved on to C# (pronounced &quot;C-Sharp&quot;) and the XNA Game Studio framework.
          XNA allowed me to really get my hands dirty in what I thought of as &quot;real programming&quot;.  A few more test projects later and I began working on a game called Steer Clear, built with the XNA framework.
          After working on several revisions of Steer Clear, I began teaching myself JavaScript by writing a HTML5 Canvas API based version of Steer Clear.
          <br /><br />
          December of 2014, I built my first computer running Windows 8 and started learning more about the inner workings of desktop and laptop computers.
          This event was the diving board which propelled me into building computers for other clients.
          <br /><br />
          Using my skills harnessed from the Steer Clear project (which will be released in 2018, by the way), I launched the first website I built for a client January of 2016.  Since then I've been discovering
          the newest in web specifications and harnessing my skills to build a second website August of 2016 for a veterinary practice.  Late August of 2016 I broke ground on working on veterinary management software for that veterinary practice,
          which I am finishing up and rolling out as of August 2017.
          <br /><br />
          July 6 2017, I founded my own computer business, <a href="http://www.yorkcs.com">York Computer Solutions LLC</a> specializing in custom web design services and computer builds.

        <h3>Art</h3>
        <p>
          When I was around seven and eight I really got hooked on drawing and sketching. This is when I realised the potential in my artistic abilities. 
          For several years I've never thought of picking drawing back up, but in 2017, I decided to start drawing seriously again.  You can view my art <a href="art.html">here</a> 
          to see what I've created.
