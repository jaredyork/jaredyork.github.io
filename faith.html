            Philippians 4:6-7 (ESV)
            “Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.  (7) And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.”  When we have anxiety we need to pray to God for peace.<br /><br />

            Jesus calls us to lay our baggage at his feet since he has already been there.  Isaiah 26:12 (ESV) says, “LORD, you establish peace for us; all that we have accomplished you have done for us.”  Even when we doubt and worry, we need not to worry about what tomorrow holds because God is already there.  It’s important to realize nothing will accomplished from worry about anything for Matthew 6:27 (ESV) states, “And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?”  So instead we need be cheerful as Proverbs 12:25 says, “Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs him down, but a good word makes him glad.”  It can be difficult to think positively and clear our minds of worry, but if we focus our attention on Jesus and be happy and cheerful, we can alleviate worry.  As said in Judges 6:12 (TLB), “The Angel of the Lord appeared to him and said, “Mighty soldier, the Lord is with you!”<br /><br />

            What strategies do you employ when you encounter a worryful situation?<br /><br />

            There are a variety of ways we can counter stress and instead focus on Jesus.  Prayer, reading devotionals, talking to Christian friends, being involved in Church are just some of many great tools in our toolbox we can use to focus on Jesus and not worry.  As stated in Romans 8:28 (ESV), “And we know that for those who love God all things will work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.”  We can live in the light that God is with us every step of our journey of faith and that there is a light on our path, that everything will be worked out for good by God’s will for our lives.<br /><br />

            Isaiah 26:3-4 (ESV), “(3)You keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you, because he trusts in you.  (4) Trust in the Lord forever, for the LORD GOD is an everlasting rock.”  Jesus is our firm foundation, the solid rock beneath our feet amidst the crashing waves that may surround us.<br /><br />

            Matthew 6:33-34 (ESV) says, “But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. (34) Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself.  Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.”<br /><br /><br />



            Have faith, seek Him, and seek His Kingdom, and trust Him, as our God is for us, not against us and will walk with us no matter what comes our way.<br /><br />

            Psalm 23:1-6, &quot;The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
            (2) He makes me lie down in green pastures.  He leads me beside still waters.
            (3) He restores my soul.  He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.&quot;
            (4) Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and staff, they comfort me.
            (5) You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.
            (6) Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD forever.

            <h2>&quot;Walking In The Light&quot;</h2>
            <p class="content-post-date">Bible Study Lesson for Nov. 14, 2017</p>

            1 John 1:5-10 (ESV)
            “This is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. (6) If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. (7) But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. (8) If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. (9) If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. (10) If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.”<br /><br />

            > What does it mean to walk in the light?
            We walk in the light by following Jesus, striving to be righteous and having faith with works.  A verse that points to this is John 3:20-21 (ESV), “(20) For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. (21) But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.”  Taking a look at verse six at the phrase “practice the truth”, in order to walk in God’s light we need to follow Jesus.  As stated in John 14:6 (ESV), “Jesus said to him, ‘I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.’”  As a result of walking in the light, fellowship is shared between believers because of their righteous lifestyle.<br /><br />

            John 8:12 (ESV)
            “(12) Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world.  Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”  John 8:12 is probably the most direct parallel to 1 John 1:5 that explains in order to walk in the light we need to follow Jesus.<br /><br />

            Matthew 5:14 (ESV)
            “(14) “You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. (15) Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. (16) In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.”<br /><br />

            Matthew 5:16 (ESV)
            “(16) In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.”

            In Matthew 5:14 and 5:16, we are called to shine God’s light among others so they may give praise and glory to the Savior that has redeemed us.  If we were to look at our life in a mirror, ask yourself, “If every Christian lived exactly like you, how many people would be attracted or turned off by the Gospel?”  You may be the only representative of Jesus and the Church that your friends, family, neighbors, classmates may ever meet.  Many people will decide whether or not Christianity is for them based on what they see in you.  This is just one of many reasons why it’s important to walk in God’s light.  Jesus calls us to be faithful, God honoring, sincere, earnest, trustworthy, honest, and loving in all that we do.  It’s important to pursue these attributes to become more like Christ so that we can be a bright light to those around us.<br />
            > What is something you can do this week to show God’s light to others?<br /><br />

            1 Peter 3:15 (ESV)
            “(15) but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect,”<br /><br />

            When we walk in the light, it’s important to know to why we believe what we believe and why we follow Jesus.  Even though it may not be easy in certain situations to share our hope in Jesus, we need to remember that the Holy Spirit will give us the words to use.  As we walk in the light, it’s important to show love and speak life to those around us, both those who have worldly lifestyles and believers alike, that we can share the light that is God and the hope and truth we have in our hearts and minds because of Him.  Psalm 22:22 (ESV) says, “I will tell of your name to my brothers;   in the midst of the congregation I will praise you:”.<br /><br />

            > Have you thought about writing a testimony about how Jesus has impacted your life?  Testimonies can be great way to share and testify what God has done for you.<br /><br />

            John 8:32 (ESV)
            “The truth will set you free.”
